*Defect vs. Bug:* 
- **Defect**: A broad term encompassing any deviation from the expected result. - **Bug**: Specifically related to coding errors; deviations from expected results caused by coding mistakes. - In practice, defects and bugs are often used interchangeably in most scenarios. - Tools like Jira track both as one category and distinguish them using the "resolution" field. 
*Error vs. Failure:* 
- **Error**: Mistakes occurring at various stages, including requirements, coding, and testing. - **Failure**: Occurs when software doesn't perform as expected due to defects or bugs. 

*Relationship Between These Terms:* 
- Errors can lead to defects or bugs. 
- Defects or bugs can result in failures when software is used or tested. 
- Not all code errors lead to immediate failures; some remain dormant until specific conditions trigger them.
