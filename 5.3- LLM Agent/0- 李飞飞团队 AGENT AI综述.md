1. 这段内容描述了AI代理从初始训练到互动学习的整个过程，并强调了AI通过不断的用户互动和反馈进行自我改进的重要性。这个过程确保了AI代理能够逐步提高其性能并提供更准确、更适合用户需求的响应。Interactive Learning: AI agents designed for interactive learning operate using a combination of machine learning techniques and user interactions. Initially, the AI agent is trained on a large dataset. This dataset includes various types of information, depending on the intended function of the agent. For instance, an AI designed for language tasks would be trained on a massive corpus of text data. The training involves using machine learning algorithms, which could include deep learning models like neural networks. These training models enable the AI to recognize patterns, make predictions, and generate responses based on the data on which it was trained. The AI agent can also learn from real-time interactions with users. This interactive learning can occur in various ways: 1) Feedback-based learning: The AI adapts its responses based on direct user feedback (Li et al., 2023b; Yu et al., 2023a; Parakh et al., 2023; Zha et al., 2023; Wake et al., 2023a,b,c). For example, if a user corrects the AI’s response, the AI can use this information to improve future responses (Zha et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a). 2) Observational Learning: The AI observes user interactions and learns implicitly. For example, if users frequently ask similar questions or interact with the AI in a particular way, the AI might adjust its responses to better suit these patterns. It allows the AI agent to understand and process human language, multi-model setting, interpret the cross reality-context, and generate human-users’ responses. Over time, with more user interactions and feedback, the AI agent’s performance generally continuous improves. This process is often supervised by human operators or developers who ensure that the AI is learning appropriately and not developing biases or incorrect patterns.

3. Recognizing task directives and taking action has been a fundamental challenge in interactive AI and natural language processing for decades. With the recent advances in deep learning, there is a growing interest in studying these areas jointly to improve human-agent collaboration. We identify three specific directions, among others, to improve language-grounded agents:  
	1. • Tool use and querying from knowledge bases. This direction emphasizes the importance of integrating external knowledge bases, web search, or other helpful tools into the reasoning processes of AI agents. By leveraging structured and unstructured data from various sources, agents can enhance their understanding and provide more accurate and context-aware responses. Furthermore, it fosters the agent’s ability to proactively seek out information when faced with unfamiliar scenarios or queries, ensuring more comprehensive and informed responses. Examples include Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) and Retrieve What You Need (Wang et al., 2023g).  
	2. • Improved agent reasoning and planning. Enhancing the agent’s ability to reason and plan is pivotal for effective human-agent collaboration. This involves the development of models that can understand complex instructions, infer user intentions, and predict potential future scenarios. This can be accomplished by asking the agent to reflect on past actions and failures as in ReAct (Yao et al., 2023a), or by structuring the agent thought process as a form of search (Yao et al., 2023b). By simulating different outcomes and assessing the ramifications of various actions, agents can make more informed context-aware decisions.  
	3. • Incorporating system and human feedback. AI agents can frequently operate in two primary contexts: environments that provide explicit signals about the effectiveness of their actions (system feedback), and settings where they collaborate with humans who can offer verbal critiques (human feedback). This direction underscores the need for adaptive learning mechanisms that allow agents to refine their strategies and rectify mistakes, such as in AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023). The ability to continuously learn and adapt from diverse feedback sources ensures that agents remain helpful and aligned for user needs.
